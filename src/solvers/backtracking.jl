    BacktrackingSearch(target_score::Int, seed::Int)

A single-threaded backtracking search with heuristics for the original Eternity II puzzle.

This algorithm is not designed to search for a perfect solution, but to find partial
solutions with a high score. Therefore a certain amount of mismatched edges is tolerated,
controlled by the `target_score` parameter.

The solver is work in progress, i.e. the parameters are probably not optimally tuned and
further speed optimizations may be possible.
